    "In this exercise, you will follow the steps of the \"Good Plot\" example that is described in the course slides. In particular, these are the steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the initial data set by placing the code below in a macro called macro1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# The number of points in the data set\n",
    "n_points = 10\n",
    "# The values along X and Y axis\n",
    "x_vals = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n",
    "y_vals = [6,12,14,20,22,24,35,45,44,53]\n",
    "# The errors on the Y axis\n",
    "y_errs = [5,5,4.7,4.5,4.2,5.1,2.9,4.1,4.8,5.43]\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Create a `TGraphErrors` instance using the aforementioned data.\n",
    "* Draw the graph data in an error bars plot. Play with the following draw options: *\"APE\", \"APEL\", \"APEC\", \"APE4\".*\n",
    "* Customize the visual aspect of the plot (marker style, marker color, line color).\n",
    "* Add a function to compare the data with a line. Use the formula \"*[0]+x*[1]*\". Set the parameters to -1 and 5. Play a little with the line style and color and draw the function in the same canvas as the graph.\n",
    "* Set the titles for the graph (\"*Measurement XYZ;length [cm];Arb.Units*\") and for the axis (\"*length [cm]*\" and \"*Arb.Units*\" for x and y). Try to add special latex characters.\n",
    "* Try to change the number of divisions of the x axis: set the number of primary divisions to 20 and check the result. Did you get that number of divisions?\n",
    "* Change the label of the x axis corresponding to the maximum deviation by setting its color to red.\n",
    "* Add a legend to the plot, with one entry for the graph and one for the function.\n",
    "* Add an arrow (`TArrow`) and some text (`TLatex`) to the canvas."
